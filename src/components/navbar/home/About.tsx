        "The only thing sharper than Vladimir’s claws is his business sense!"
      </h3>
      <p>
        Vladimir’s story is one of inspiration and hard work (and plenty of
        naps). As a kitten, he discovered his passion for kneading dough and
        hasn’t looked back since. Today, he’s the proud CEO, Head Biscuit
        Designer, and Quality Control Officer of Vladimir’s Biscuit Business.
        Every recipe is tested and approved by Vladimir himself (trust us, he’s
        very picky).
